    gaussian([T=Float64], point; x, y, fwhm, amp=1, theta=0, bkg=0)
    gaussian([T=Float64], px, py; x, y, fwhm, amp=1, theta=0, bkg=0)

An unnormalized bivariate Gaussian distribution. The position can be specified
in `(x, y)` coordinates as a `Tuple`, `AbstractVector`, or as separate
arguments. If `theta` is given, the PSF will be rotated by `theta` degrees
counter-clockwise from the x-axis. If `bkg` is given it will be added as a
scalar to the PSF.

The `fwhm` can be a scalar (isotropic) or a vector/tuple (diagonal). Keep in
mind that `theta` has no effect for isotropic distributions and is degenerate
with the `fwhm` parameters (i.e., theta=90 is the same as reversing the `fwhm`
tuple)

# Functional form
```math
f(x | x̂, \mathrm{FWHM}) = \exp[-4 \ln(2) ⋅ ||x - x̂|| / \mathrm{FWHM}^2]
```
where `x̂` and `x` are position vectors (indices) `||⋅||` represents the
square-distance, and `FWHM` is the full width at half-maximum. If `FWHM` is a
scalar, the Gaussian distribution will be isotropic. If `FWHM` is a vector or
tuple, the weighting is applied along each axis (diagonal).
